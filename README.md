# MyCarNotes

Project to develop a app for taking notes of car maintanance and most of  stuff we do, like refueling and etc

The image that follows has our modeling to understand more about the project's domains and what will be needed to develop the project. That is a important step, before any code is written, so the resulting code will be more clean and well structured, so so we hope.
